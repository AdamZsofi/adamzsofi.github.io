## <i class="fas fa-user fa-fw"></i> About Me
I am a PhD student at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, working on formal methods, mainly model checkers. I am interested in the model checking process, as a whole: from different application domains and model transformations through different algorithms, portfolios and algorithm selection to validation and certification. My focus is on applicability and usability of model checkers on real world projects. I have experience not just with software verification, but also with the formal verification of PLC code, hardware and engineering models.

My PhD advisor is [Dr. Zoltán Micskei](http://mit.bme.hu/~micskeiz/).
